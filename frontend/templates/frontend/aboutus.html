        Sounds shape the way we feel and see the world, yet we don’t often stop and listen, much less collect and share the sounds that surround us.
        <br><br>
        Do you remember the sound of dial-up internet? What about the whistle of an old kettle, the sound of the coffee machine at your favourite café, the no-sound of a silent elevator, or a wine cork popping.
        All of these sounds are associated with emotions and memory.
        <br><br>
        The Museum of Sound allows you to share sounds, as well as sharing your stories about why these sounds are meaningful to you.
        <br><br>
        Get involved by recording a short sound clip on the 'Record a Sound' page and telling us why this sound matters to you.
        <br><br>
        The Museum of Sound is curated and created by Dr. Sarah Collins, UWA and developed as a project for computer science students in CITS3200, 2018 and CITS5504, 2019-2020.
